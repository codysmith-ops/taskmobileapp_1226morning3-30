# Xcode Environment Configuration for React Native
# This file is used by Xcode build scripts to locate Node.js and configure the build environment

# Node binary path - automatically detects your node installation
export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node)

# Increase Node.js memory limit for large projects (optional)
# Uncomment the line below if you experience out-of-memory errors during build
# export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"

# Ensure Node.js is in the PATH for Xcode build scripts
# Supports Homebrew installations on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/$(node -v)/bin"

# Optionally set specific Node version if using nvm
# Uncomment and adjust the version as needed
# export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
# nvm use 18  # or your preferred version
